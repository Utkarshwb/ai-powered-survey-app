# ðŸš¨ SECURITY INCIDENT RESPONSE CHECKLIST

## Exposed API Keys - IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED

### âœ… STEP 1: REVOKE EXPOSED KEYS (DO THIS NOW!)

**Google Gemini API Key:** `AIzaSyBx1kLoVOHr1qWT05ZJhOCIQh7KOC8VEkY`
- [ ] Go to https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey
- [ ] Delete the exposed key
- [ ] Generate a new key
- [ ] Update .env file with new key

**Resend API Key:** `re_CTM3qdjx_7vPotwkSZapXYexJqorTe4hq`
- [ ] Go to https://resend.com/api-keys
- [ ] Revoke the exposed key
- [ ] Generate a new key
- [ ] Update .env file with new key

### âœ… STEP 2: VERIFY SECURITY

- [ ] Check Google AI Studio usage dashboard for unauthorized activity
- [ ] Check Resend dashboard for unexpected email sends
- [ ] Monitor billing for unusual charges over next 48 hours
- [ ] Verify .env file is in .gitignore (âœ… Already confirmed)

### âœ… STEP 3: RESTART APPLICATION

```bash
# After updating .env with new keys:
npm run dev
```

### âœ… STEP 4: FUTURE PREVENTION

- [ ] Never hardcode API keys in source code
- [ ] Use environment variables for all secrets
- [ ] Regular key rotation (every 3-6 months)
- [ ] Set up usage alerts in API dashboards
- [ ] Review code before sharing in chat/screenshots
