# Authentication Setup for Survey App

## Overview
The authentication system is now configured to allow anonymous users to respond to surveys while requiring authentication for survey creation and management.

## Public Access (No Authentication Required)
- `/` - Home page with login/signup options
- `/survey/[id]` - Survey response pages for published surveys
- `/survey-not-found` - Error page for invalid surveys
- `/api/survey/*` - All survey response APIs
- `/api/send-survey-feedback/` - Email feedback API

## Protected Routes (Authentication Required)
- `/dashboard` - Survey management dashboard
- `/surveys/new` - Create new surveys
- `/surveys/[id]` - Edit existing surveys
- `/feedback` - Feedback management
- `/api/export/*` - Data export APIs
- `/api/ai/*` - AI-powered features (for survey creators)

## How it Works

### For Survey Respondents (Anonymous)
1. Users can access survey links directly: `https://yourapp.com/survey/[survey-id]`
2. No login required - they can immediately start answering questions
3. Survey responses are stored with anonymous sessions
4. Email feedback is automatically sent if email is detected in responses

### For Survey Creators (Authenticated)
1. Must create account and login to access dashboard
2. Can create, edit, and manage surveys
3. Can view analytics and export data
4. Can use AI-powered features for survey enhancement

## Technical Implementation

### Middleware Configuration
The middleware (`lib/supabase/middleware.ts`) has been updated to allow public access to:
- Survey response routes (`/survey/`)
- Survey API endpoints (`/api/survey/`)
- Survey feedback API (`/api/send-survey-feedback/`)

### Database Security
- Survey responses are stored with session-based tracking (no user ID required)
- Published surveys are publicly accessible
- Private surveys and survey management require authentication

## Testing Public Access

To test that anonymous users can access surveys:

1. Create a survey while logged in
2. Publish the survey
3. Copy the survey URL
4. Open the URL in an incognito window (no login should be required)
5. Complete the survey
6. Verify response is saved and email feedback is sent (if applicable)

## Example Survey URLs
- Public survey: `http://localhost:3000/survey/123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000`
- Survey not found: `http://localhost:3000/survey-not-found`

## Security Notes
- Anonymous responses are tracked by session ID and IP address
- Email addresses are only captured if voluntarily provided in responses
- No personal data is required for survey participation
- Survey creators maintain full control over their surveys and data
